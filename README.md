# Future improvements
1. Currently project does not hold logged user in a local storage. It is just kept as state such that if you refresh it requests info from GitHub restApi with empty string :)
2. Other tabs in the GitHub page such as overview or stars should be added.
3. Styling should be kept in seperate files and hardcoded values should be minimized.
4. Storybook should be integrated.

# Feedback
The project requirements are not the most clear. This could be improved. And the task is highly frontend oriented for a fullstack position. Backend should also be integrated.
