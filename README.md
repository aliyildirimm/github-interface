# Github Repositories Search Bar
This is a interview task that creates a primitive GitHub Repositories page. Main purpose is to both display repositories and create responsive search bar with it. This project uses official GitHub API to fetch user related ONLY PUBLIC data. For some of the components, MUI V5 has been used for designing the web application.

# Future improvements
1. Currently project does not hold logged user in a local storage. It is just kept as state such that if you refresh it requests info from GitHub restApi with empty string :)
2. Other tabs in the GitHub page such as overview or stars should be added.
3. Styling should be kept in seperate files and hardcoded values should be minimized.
4. Storybook should be integrated.
5. User sidebar could be improved (style and components).

# Feedback
The project requirements are not the most clear. This could be improved. And the task is highly frontend oriented for a fullstack position. Backend should also be integrated.
